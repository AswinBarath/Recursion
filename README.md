# Recursion
*Tips, Notes, Patterns & Problem solving based on the Recursion concepts*

## Tips

- This is the most important concept from all of the Data Structures and Algorithms concepts
- Recursion provides the base knowledge for more than 90% of the topics involving problem-solving
- Clear understanding of Recursion is important to solve problems like:
	- Binary Trees
	- Linked lists
	- Binary Search Trees
	- Dynamic Programming
	- Heaps
	- Graphs
	- Traversals
- Prerequisites for Recursion:
	- Functions
	- Memory Management
- You will face difficulties while learning Recursion, **so don't skip it! don't give up!**
- Because once you understand recursion its very easy to proceed with problem solving 
- **Don't break your learning streak!** 

## Working of function calls

- Until function is not finished execution, it will remain in call stack
